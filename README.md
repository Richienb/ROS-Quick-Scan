# ROS QuickScan
An easy tool to scan files. First released in October 2017.

ROS QuickScan is a tool for checking single files against a list of hashes provided by [VirusShare Hashes](https://github.com/Richienb/virusshare-hashes). 

## Complete security
You can scan any type of files which are then compared with the thousands of MD5s in the library.

## Community powered index
The ever growing Virus MD5 Hashlist is open to community contributions. At the moment, it is automatically updated with [hashes from VirusShare](https://www.richie-bendall.ml/virusshare-hashes/).

## Download
You can install the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/Richienb/ROS-Quick-Scan/releases) of this repository.
